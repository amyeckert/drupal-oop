1. Abstraction- desscribing ideas susinctly turn left vs describe the drive train engine in a car. google search  
2. Encapsulation- keep details hidden, need to know basis, public/private
3. Inheritance- branch off a parent definition or class.
4. Polymorphism- an interface, describe a general type of object, which can then create variations.

php-fig.org

Classes- a plan, the blueprint, allows for mass production
    Classes are objects
    class names are camel-cased "BigHouse"
    props and methods are lower camel-cased bigHouse
    variables -- look at PSR
    1 class per file
    don't include closing php tag- header errors! White space on new line is interpreted as content and sent causing errors.
    file name should match class name

Object- an instance, the constructed house itself
    $myHouse = new House ()
    data = properties- holds data- can manage it's own state
    behaviour

use -> to access methods and properties in an object.
    return $this->$num_rooms;

Autoloading
    Namespaces 
    - directed graph allows you to pick and choose what to use when.
    - organization
    - avoid collisions & code confusion
    - can contain many classes in a namespace
    O3_views vs drupal_views...

    Composer- 
    - dependency manager for php
    - packagist.org public repo for php packages
    - autoloading is built in, 
        -generates a php file that can search and find their way to the file. 
        - allows devs to use USE keyword with namespaces
        require_once(__DIR__ . "/src/Car.php); need to know exact location of file
        vs
        require_once(__DIR__ . "/autoloader.php); one and done
        use\Vehicles\Car  // use the Car class in the Vehicles namespace
        use\o3\views vs. use\drupal\views
        - Can have a directory in which namespaced classes live,but a namespace doesn't get it's own .php file. 

        $ composer init
        $ composer require <name> // add packages
        $ composer install // fetches and installs in /vendor, also generates the autoloader.php

        Drupal is a dependency of composer project, Like module development. 

        Use PSR4 auto loader tells composer that file struction follows that standard.
        
        In composer.json, add this block to create a map to this: 
        "autoload": {
            "psr-4": {
                "Vehicles\\": "src/Vehicles",
                "Other\\" => array($baseDir . '/src/Other')
            }
        },
        will update the autoload_psr4.php to include these ^^.
        Will NOT create the directory structure tho.

Reusing Code:: Inheritance
    - extends a parent class
    - inherits Public and Protected methods and props.
    - single inheritance - only one base class can be extended
    Directed Graph shape of tree 

Testing
    -unit testing -individual modules, low level
    test suites need to be maintained and upgraded
    php-unit
    $ composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit ^6
    PHPUnit needs to be told what the autoloader is:
    src file                use this autoloader:            run this test:
    $ ./vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap ./vendor/autoload.php tests/CarTest

Polymorphism 
    Similar properties between pieces of things. 
    ex. Every shape has an area, for ex. Each area is calculated differently, but they share property.
    Interfaces-D8
        - contract or a set of requirements that must be implemented.

    function getVehicleMake(CarInterface $anyCar){
        return $anyCar->getMake();
    }

    Classes can implement multiple interfaces. 

Dependency Injection
    
    // this car can be constructed with only a specific Engine class.
    public function __construct(Engine $e) {
        $this->e = $e;
    }

    // car can be built with any engine since EngineInterface requires an engine of some kind... injected dependency as an function argument-
    public function __construct(EngineInterface $e) {
        $this->e = $e;
    } 

D8 module structure
    -yml pay attention to whitespace!
    - add to or extend something that doesn't exist. 
    /modules/custom/hello/hello.info.yml
    example creates a page where we can work on test suites
    basic pattern:
    1. build a tool
    2. tell drupal about tool

    Controller handles request, returns result to browser
        -notice that if you're in /src/Controller is a namespace
    modules/custom/hello/src/Controller/HelloController.php
    make tool #1. 
    in HelloController.php
    namespace Drupal\hello\Controller;

    use Drupal\Core\Controller\ControllerBse;

    class HelloController extends ControllerBase {
        public function sayHi() {
            // returns render array
            return array(
                '#markup' => "Hello Drupal 8!",
            );
        }
    }

    #2.
    in modules/custom/hello/hello.router.yml:

    hello.sayHi:
    path: '/hello'
    defaults: 
        _controller: '\Drupal\hello\Controller\HelloController::sayHi'   
    requirements:
        _role: 'admin'
        _permission: 'access content'



Hook system is event listener system, observer pattern 
\Drupal global object 

Services
    a stateless object that can be written in a Class, performs a testable task.
    smallest piece of functionality
    Drupal has a service container is a PHP object that manages the instantiation of services. 
    in /src dir
    namespace Drupal\hello;

    class HelloService {
        public function doSomeWork() {
            //does some stuff here
            drupal_set_message ("Hello Service!");
        }
    }
    register new service with Ddrupal in HelloService.yml
    services: 
    hello.hello_service:
        class: Drupal\hello\HelloService
